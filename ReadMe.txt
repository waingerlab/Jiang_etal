These scripts were used in Jiang et al. to count live motor neurons over time. The motor neurons express a nuclear BFP2, and were imaged at several timepoints using an IMX micro confocal. These Matlab scripts were written by Aaron Held (Wainger Lab) to quantify cell number over time.

To use these scripts, start with nucleicounts_batch_230510.m and ensure that the "addpath" lines point to the correct directories (folders in this repository). Then ensure that the "glob" functions point to the .tif files of interest. 

Questions regarding these scripts or the image analysis should be directed to Aaron Held (aheld2@mgh.harvard.edu)
